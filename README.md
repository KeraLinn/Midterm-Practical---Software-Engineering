# Midterm Practical - Software Engineering

Midterm Practical completed for Software Engineering class at Full Sail University, Term C202207, Section 02.

Per instructions, the program is designed to display a random multiple choice question to the user, receive their answer, and tell them if they are correct or not. I added additional code to make it so that you can display and answer as many questions as you'd like, although only 4 questions have been implemented.
